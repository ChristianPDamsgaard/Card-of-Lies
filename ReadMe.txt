Before playing game:
*Only one person should run Main, and should only choose 'h' for host.
*If offline use main and the test classes to play game. Also recommended for Online to use different Test classes.
*Offline needs to have the String variable id to be "localhost" or other similar.
*Online needs to have the String variable ip be the ip instead.
*Both requires the Main and Test classes to have a similar ip.
*Each player must write a username and ID.

How to play:
*Host decides when to start game.
*If it is first turn, then the player can only choose between cards to play.
*Any other are allowed to either choose to play a card ('c') or call out player ('p').
*If you played a card not matching the host, you have "lied", where if you are called out, then you have to shoot yourself, which works like Russian roulette.
*This will keep going until only 1 person is left.

Known bugs:
*Sometimes it seems that with multiple players, the spaces know what other players have written and therefore cause a "Invalid choice", even if you have written nothing.
*When playing online, sometimes it occurs that a player does not have any cards to play. (Fixed by punching).
*Potentially a small bug where one player needs to play a turn after game should be over.
